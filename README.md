## BandecoRun

It's a running game project made in Python for the Games Laboratory chair at the Universidade Federal Fluminense.

The project was developed using Python, mainly through a Pygame framework called PPlay, developed by professors of the university to facilitate learning.

It consists in a run to get to the university to have lunch, while dodging obstacles and collecting coins to buy items and special power ups.

The game was made using the functional programming paradigm, since I didn't have learned OOP by the time I was doing the project, and using it would probably lead to some performance issues.
